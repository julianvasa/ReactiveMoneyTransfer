# Reactive Money Transfer Application

A RESTful API that allows transfer money from one Bank Account to another in any currency.

It uses two entities:
* transaction - the money transfer transaction used to initialize the transaction
* account - the bank account which has balance in the specified currency

The API was developed using Java 8 based on Vert.x.

Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM.
Eclipse Vert.x is event driven and non blocking. This means your app can handle a lot of concurrency using a small number of kernel threads. Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.

Some of the reasons why i choose Vert.x for this task are listed below:

- Vert.x is lightweight
- Vert.x is fast
- Vert.x is not an application server. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
- Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
- Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
- Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
- Simple to use concurrency and scalability
- Polyglot. You can use Vert.x with multiple languages including Java, JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby, Ceylon, Scala and Kotlin.

The threading model proposed by the event loop has a huge benefit:
it simplifies concurrency. As there is only one thread, you are always
called by the same thread and never concurrently. 
The single thread event-loop principle guaranties the data consistency in any case, even if it will be a huge amount concurrent users. 


## Requires
* Java 8
* Maven

## How to start

Once the application is fetched from git it can be built with maven

    mvn clean install
    
This will fetch dependencies and run all tests

To run the app execute:

    java -jar /target/moneytransfer.jar

The application will start on the `localhost` and will be listening to the port `8080`

## API Definition

### Account
The bank account entity which has balance in the specified currency and could transfer the money
if there is enough money.

#### Structure
    {
        "id"        : <number>,

### Transaction
The money transfer transaction used to initialize the transaction. Once created
will be executed automatically. If transaction can not be created by some reason the Error
will be returned with details in the body.

#### Structure
    {
        "id"            : <number>,
        "fromAccount"   : <number>,
        "toAccount"     : <number>,

        "description"   : <string>
    }
    
#### Create a transaction

The following creates a new transaction if possible (valid Bank Accounts and parameters should be provided).
Once `id`, `creationDate`, `updateDate` or `status` provided they  will be ignored. 
You can obtain the generated values of these fields in the response of this call. 

    POST /transactions
    {
        "fromAccount"   : 222222222,
        "toAccount"     : 1111,

      "path"        : "/transactions/122"
    }

## To do

 - Call https://api.exchangeratesapi.io to get the latest currency convertions rates when initiating a Transaction
 - Accounts and Transactions are stored in 2 LinkedHashMaps to keep it simple. Possible future integration with a NoSQL database (ex. MongoDb, Couchbase, Cassandra). https://vertx.io/docs/#data_access
 - Split the main Verticle in 2 Verticles: Accounts and Transactions...communicate through a Service Bus
 - or ...maybe change completely to a microservices architecture based on Verticles
